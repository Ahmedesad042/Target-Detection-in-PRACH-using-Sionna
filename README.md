# Target-Detection-in-PRACH-using-Sionna

In this project we implemented stationary target detection using PRACH channel. We utilizied Sionna library to obtain a channel. Using multiple multiple transmitters we were able to localiz an object's coordinates.

This project was originated from Enes Aydın's undergraduate project from ITU.
